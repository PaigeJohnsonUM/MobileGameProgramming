I would like to either be on the information organizing or asset gathering/generating team since I tend to not be very adept when it comes to programming and I tend to get frustrated fairly easily.


In my experience in using Bubble, There have been several marked positives in their creation system. The ui is very clean and well organized, and allows the user to customize the sizes and shapes of their site elements. Bubble also uses a relatively hands off system for programing the different elements of the site to preform the desired actions and connections. Some limitations for bubble is their tutorial section is often either too handholding or too vague causing way to much time to be spent just trying to figure out what the tutorial is trying to get you to do. The rigidity of the components also makes it harder for a developer to make something more complicated or new in their system. Overall, Bubble is a great example to learn from playing around on your own, but I personally will likely not use it again.
